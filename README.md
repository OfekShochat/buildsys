# buildsys
this is a pretty fast build system. building my chess engine in 1 second (in src).      
this is a build system which runs in the speed of ninja, but does all the work with easy to use build files which are very high level functions and on python. which means you can 
customize it however you would want! currently it supports only c/c++ with cl.exe
